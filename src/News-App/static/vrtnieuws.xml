            centre in the Brussels municipality of Ukkel. The amount of precipitation for the winter as a whole has been
            more or less normal. Nevertheless, nature could certainly use a bit of additional rain to help prepare it
            for the potentially dry summer months that are coming up.

        <summary type="text">Cinéma Aventure in Brussels had to be evacuated last night after a dozen cinemagoers became
            unwell suffering breathing difficulty and irritation of the eyes. The fire service believes chemical
            substances used in neighbouring nail bars may have caused the incident. One woman even had to be
            hospitalised.

        <summary type="text">A Dutch judge has refused to send a Chinese asylum seeker back to Belgium out of concerns
            he could face inhumane treatment at the hands of the Belgian authorities. The Chinese national applied for
            asylum in the Netherlands last summer, but it soon emerged he had already applied in Belgium. As a result
            his application couldn’t be processed by the Dutch authorities. Under European rules he was supposed to be
            sent back to Belgium. The Chinese appealed against that decision pointing to the lack of capacity for asylum
            seekers south of the border.

        <summary type="text">Higher gas and electricity prices generated higher pretax profits for power company Engie
            last year. Pretax profits were up 2 billion to 5 billion in 2022. In 2021 the company only made profits of 3
            billion euros. However, the Belgian government introduced a tax surcharge on excessive profits by energy
            companies reducing Engie’s net profits to 200 million euros. Engie made excessive profits because it
            generates most of its energy from nuclear at no extra cost but was able to benefit from higher market prices
            triggered by Russia’s further invasion of Ukraine.
